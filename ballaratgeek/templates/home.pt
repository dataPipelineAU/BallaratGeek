        <p>
            There is a lot of information in the text that we create and keep in our businesses, but extracting useful information from it is difficult.
            We have expertise in extracting data from text; whether it comes from an online social network, survey responses, a collection of books in the office, or transcripts of meetings with clients.
            Our techniques can perform exploratory analysis, such as looking for general themes or trends, or to answer specific questions you may have about the data.
